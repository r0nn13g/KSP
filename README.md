Keep tabs on your favorite live streamers recent titles, followers, when they go live and viewer count all in one place. Still a work in progress!

## Instructions to run app locally 

I have some pre-wrtitten scripts to make this process a lot easier. 

` npm install `

And finally to start the server that can be checked in your local browser just run the script

```npm start```
