# Kickstream PRO for Kick.com Live Streaming Platform

https://kickstreampro.netlify.app
```
## Notes
Keep in mind Kick has not released their API to the public and cloud flare will temporarily soft ban your ip address if you quickly navigate between routes which result in making too many calls under 1 minute. 
If you find that /Live is not responsive, clear web data and clear cache from your device, wait a minute or two and relaunch the app.
```
```
## IOS App instructions

coming soon.
```
```
## Instructions to run app locally 

I have some pre-wrtitten scripts to make this process a lot easier. 

` npm install `

And finally to start the server that can be checked in your local browser just run the script

```npm start```
```
